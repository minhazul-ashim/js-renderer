              <p><strong>Var : </strong> var is the old school method of javascript to declare and defined variables. They can only be accessible within the function where they are defined. And var is hoisted to the top of the containing function and the global scope, but it can be accessed without initializing it and declaring it, that means it won't throw error, but we will get an undefined message. </p>

              <p><strong>Let : </strong> Let is comparatively newer way to declare variables in javascript. It can be only used within its immediate block. Let is hoisted to the top of containing block, but we cannot use it before declaring it, it will throw error. </p>

              <p><strong>Const : </strong> Const is also block scoped as well. It's hoisted to the top of it's containing block, but it has to be declared and also initialized before using it somewhere. Bcz const cannot be reassigned values after initializing it, so, it has to be initialized before use. </p>

              <p><strong>Null : </strong> Null can be used for many reasons, such as if we don't have any intial data for something, we can assign null there. Or if we want to do any conditional rendering, we can use it as if or else option. And we can also use it as a return value of a function. </p>

              <p><strong>Undefined :</strong> Undefined is often a default value for some properties in JS. Suppose if we haven't declared var, or we have't initialized let variables, JS returns undefined there. And when we try to access any absent properties in object or out of index elements of an array, we get undefined there. Also we can use it as a placeholder explicitly and we can also use it as a function return type explicitly and it does return undefined implicitly, we are not returning anything from that function. </p>

              <p><strong>REST API</strong> The full form of REST API is Representational state transfer Application Programming Interface. It is used to communicate between frontend and backend of an application. We define endpoints in the backend, and when we make a request to that endpoint. Our backend does some processing and gives back a response against that request. That means REST API is used for data transfer between frontend and backend of a project.</p>
